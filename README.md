## ðŸ“– Info

<p>
Shell_Wizard is a game to learn the zShell-commands.
It was made during the course of a webdevelopment coding-bootcamp.
</p>
While you use one side of the screen for typing in the commands in a shell, you get visual feedback on the other side.
<p>
As a wizard you explore rooms of a maze, that resembles an office-space.
With the commands you can find a library, private rooms and more. If you get lost on your way, you can use a Spellbook to remember the commands:

<p>
This was made as a counter draft to the learning games i played during bootcamp. I tried to make progress more natural and to create an immersive attempt on the to be conveyed content.
<p/>
<p>
I will try to update this from time to time, so if you play it i would be pleased to get some feedback. 
Please note that you can play this on your mobile, even in horizontal-mode, but the most luxerious version will be on a bigger screen.
